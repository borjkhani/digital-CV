### Computational Modeling
__Investigating the Role of Inhibitory Interneurons in Shaping Orientation Selectivity in the Primary Visual Cortex Using a Biophysical Computational Model of a Cortical Column:__ Developed and analyzed a biophysical computational model of a cortical column to investigate how inhibitory interneurons influence orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex. The project focused on understanding the complex interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and their role in processing visual stimuli. My contributions involved constructing the model, performing simulations, and analyzing neural activity patterns to elucidate the mechanisms of orientation selectivity.

__Computational Modeling of Opioid-Induced Synaptic Plasticity, Memory, and Neuron-Astrocyte Interactions in the Hippocampus During Addiction:__ This comprehensive project integrates multiple computational studies focused on the effects of opioids on hippocampal synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and neuron-astrocyte interactions. The combined modeling approach examines how opioid exposure induces synaptic changes, contributes to pathological memory formation, and disrupts neuron-glia communication, all critical factors in the development of addiction. The project also explores potential strategies for preventing opioid-induced memory formation and mitigating addiction. By simulating the complex interplay between neurons and astrocytes and their response to opioids, this work provides a holistic understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying addiction and offers insights for potential therapeutic interventions. published papers are:
